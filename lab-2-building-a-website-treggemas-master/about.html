                    Can goats wear sweaters?
                    Beautiful, fashionable sweaters. Well, strictly speaking, Gorlizki didn't just take pictures of
                    goats in sweaters. He found goats in burlap sacks, pants, fabrics of all kinds. But while the goats
                    are undeniably stylish (look at these cuffs!), Gorlizki says that they are not being dressed for
                    fun.
